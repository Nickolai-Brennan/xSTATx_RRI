## 🔗 Integration Flow

- **RowZero ➔ Snowflake** (Direct load scripts)
- **Snowflake ➔ Google Sheets ➔ Looker Studio** (or direct Snowflake ➔ Looker Studio connector)
- **Looker Studio ➔ Embed into WordPress**
- **GitHub** hosts scripts for:
  - ETL automation
  - Data refresh
  - WordPress update scripts
- **Hostinger** manages WordPress hosting, SSL, and domain settings.

## 📈 Example Use Case

> *"Daily MLB Player Statistics Pipeline"*  
>
> 1. Pull player stats daily via **RowZero** → raw backup in **Box**.  
> 2. Process and clean in **Google Sheets** → pushed to **Snowflake**.  
> 3. Visualize live stats with **Looker Studio**, auto-updating on **WordPress** blog.  
> 4. Store ETL scripts in **GitHub**, site hosted on **Hostinger**.

Would you also like me to create a **fancier README version** with:
- Badges (e.g., "Built With Snowflake," "Hosted on Hostinger," "Powered by OpenAI")
- GitHub Shields (for stars, forks, license)
- Embed a simple diagram for the workflow map?

It would make the GitHub page look *really* polished 🔥 — want me to build that too? 🚀
